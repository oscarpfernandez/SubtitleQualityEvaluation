It would be everything for the 
<Sync time="1.768"/>
individual,
<Sync time="1.827"/>
of course.
<Sync time="1.972"/>
I’m sure there will be lots of 
<Sync time="3.021"/>
people
<Sync time="3.08"/>
who will... 
<Sync time="3.128"/>
The sport as a whole would be great. 
<Sync time="4.102"/>
I’m sure if you speak to the rest of the 
<Sync time="5.264"/>

<Sync time="5.368"/>
that’s what everyone is trying to do.

<Sync time="7.273"/>
try to race for a 
<Sync time="7.823"/>
medal. 
<Sync time="7.906"/>

<Sync time="9.802"/>
stone 
<Sync time="9.854"/>
for experience leading up to 2012.
