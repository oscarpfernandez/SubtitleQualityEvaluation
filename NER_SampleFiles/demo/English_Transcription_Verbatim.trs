Oh, I think it’d be, be, be everything for, for the 
<Sync time="0.455"/>
individual, 
<Sync time="0.547"/>
of course, and, 
<Sync time="0.829"/>
you know, I’m sure, you know, there’d be loads of 
<Sync time="1.339"/>
people, 
<Sync time="1.627"/>
you know, all the personal supporters but obviously, you know, 
<Sync time="2.690"/>
the sport as a whole would be great. 
<Sync time="3.737"/>
You know, I’m sure

<Sync time="5.922"/>

<Sync time="8.192"/>
you know, hopefully and if it’s one of the younger ones, 
<Sync time="8.764"/>
or myself or whoever, you know, it’ll be a stepping 
<Sync time="9.182"/>
stone
<Sync time="9.268"/>
to, to, to, for experience leading up to 2012.
