It would be everything for the individual, of course. I’m sure there will be lots of people who will... The sport as a whole would be great. I’m sure if you speak to the rest of the guys, that’s what everyone is trying to do. Get a good performance and try to race for a medal. It is the pinnacle of your career. Hopefully if it is one of the younger ones or myself, whoever, it will be a steppifor experience leading up to 2012.
